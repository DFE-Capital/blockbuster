Title: Deterioration model of the School Estate.

Description: This R package allows you to simulate the deterioration of
    School buildings through time using a Discrete Time Markov Chain. The data
    were collected during the Property Data Survey Programme (PDSP) of 2012-2014.
    Approximately 2.7 million rows of data were collected. This provides the initial
    state of the School Estate at time zero. The deterioration of the School Estate
    is then modelled by using deterioration rates associated with each Construction
    Elements-Sub-element-construction-type.
