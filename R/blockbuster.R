# BLOCKBUSTER -------------------------------------------------------------

#' The deterioration of a blockbuster_tibble through time.
#' 
#' High level modelling of a blockbuster_tibble through time that considers
#' maintenance and rebuilding interventions on the condition of the modelled building components.
#' It is composed of many smaller functions.

#' Outputs a list of blockbuster_tibbles with each tibble containing
#' the \code{unit_area} and condition of the \code{element sub_element constr_type} 
#' combination at a given timestep while also duplicating all
#'  other variables and values from the input tibble. This is not as expensive as it sounds
#'  because modifying a list no longer makes a deep copy; modifying a list efficiently reuses
#'  existing vectors (R >= 3.1.0).  
#' After each timestep is simulated the \code{unit_area} are aggregated by identifying features, e.g.
#' \code{buildingid}, \code{elementid} and \code{grade}. 
#' Then repair cost estimates are calculated using \code{\link{blockcoster_lookup}} to find the correct constant which
#' is multiplied by the \code{unit_area} to give the expected repair \code{cost} (the initial
#' \code{unit_area} at time zero is estimated using \code{\link{areafy2}}). Grade E building
#' components don't have a repair cost (they can't be repaired and must be rebuilt) thus
#' a seperate variable \code{block_rebuild_cost} is needed to quantify their cost.
#'  This cost value applies to the estimated rebuild
#' cost of the whole block (not just that one building component)
#'  based on the argument \code{rebuild_cost_rate} (Â£ per m^2). The  \code{rebuild_cost_rate}
#'  is also used to quantify the cost of decommissioned \code{unit_area}, creating the new variable
#'  \code{cost_decommissioned} (zero cost for condition grades not E).  This ideas is being developed
#'  and may be introduced into later versions of blockbuster. For the moment we simplify
#'  by adding a costing for E grade to the \code{\link{blockcoster_lookup}}, this simply
#'  takes the D grade costing and adds 5% to it (based on expert domain knowledge of AB).

#' @param blockbuster_tibble a blockbuster dataframe or tibble. 
#' @param forecast_horizon an integer for the number of timesteps to model deterioration over.
#' @param rebuild_cost_rate a numeric vector of length equal to the \code{forecast_horizon} or one.
#' @param rebuild_monies a numeric vector of length equal to the \code{forecast_horizon} or one.
#' @param repair_monies a numeric vector of length equal to the \code{forecast_horizon} or one.
#' @return A list of n plus one tibbles (where n is the \code{forecast_horizon}). 
#' The first tibble is the initial \code{blockbuster_tibble}.
