# BLOCKBUSTER -------------------------------------------------------------

#' The deterioration of a \code{blockbuster_tibble} through time.
#' 
#' High level modelling of a blockbuster_tibble through time that considers
#' repairs and rebuilding interventions on the condition of the modelled building components.
#' It is composed of many smaller functions that deteriorate, rebuild and repair the \code{blockbuster_tibble}.

#' Outputs a list of blockbuster_tibbles with each tibble containing
#' the \code{unit_area} and condition of the \code{element sub_element constr_type} 
#' combination at a given \code{timestep} while also duplicating all
#'  other variables and values from the input tibble. This is not as expensive as it sounds
#'  because modifying a list no longer makes a deep copy; modifying a list efficiently reuses
#'  existing vectors (R >= 3.1.0).  
#' After each \code{timestep} is simulated the \code{unit_area} are aggregated by identifying features, e.g.
#' \code{buildingid}, \code{elementid} and \code{grade}. 
#' Then repair cost estimates are calculated using \code{\link{blockcoster_lookup}}
#'  to find the correct constant which
#' is multiplied by the \code{unit_area} to give the expected repair \code{cost} (the initial
#' \code{unit_area} at time zero is estimated using \code{\link{areafy2}}). Grade E building
#' components have a repair cost of 5 per cent on Grade D, see
#' \code{\link{blockbuster_pds_repair_costs}} for repair cost details.
#'  A seperate variable \code{block_rebuild_cost} is created to help quantify Grade E cost.
#'  This cost value applies to the estimated rebuild
#' cost of the whole block (not just that one building component)
#'  based on the argument \code{rebuild_cost_rate} (Â£ per m^2). For the moment we simplify
#'  by adding a costing for E grade to the \code{\link{blockcoster_lookup}}, this simply
#'  takes the D grade costing and adds 5 per cent to it 
#'  (based on expert domain knowledge of @@adam.bray@education.gov.uk).
