# REPAIR -----------------------------------------------------------------
#'
#' A helper function that updates the \code{repair_status} of building components in a block.
#' 
#' Outputs a block_tibble after spending \code{per_block_spend} on one block. Used in the 
#' \code{\link{repair}} function. A new binary variable is created of the \code{repair_status} 
#' of each building component within the block (later dropped in the \code{\link{repair}} function).
#'  The building components are sorted by 
#' descending grade and then descending cost in the \code{\link{repair}} function prior to 
#' being passed to this helper function.
#' 
#' This function works by first checking if there's anything to repair in the block. If not,
#' it returns the input argument \code{block_tibble}. Only building components of \code{grade} 
#' B, C or D are considered for repair. If a building component has a repair cost of zero
#' it is also ignored for repair (these two logical tests are applied using an "OR"). As the
#' passed tibble would have been sorted by grade and then cost the function proceeds through
#' the sorted dataframe repairing what building components it can until all the money is spent. 
#' Money is divided evenly between each \code{buildingid} or block based on the \code{\link{repair}} function.
#'
#' @param block_tibble a block dataframe or tibble with a \code{costs}variable.
#' @param per_block_spend a scalar calculated from \code{repair_monies} / number of blocks. 
#' @return A \code{block_tibble} that has had building components ready to be
#'  repaired or not indicated
#' by the new variable \code{repair_status}.

#' An internal function that determines repairs intervention effect on a blockbuster_tibble.
#' 
#' A given amount of money (\code{repair_monies}) is invested in repairing
#'  the \code{blockbuster_tibble}, passed as an arguement to the function. 
#'  The \code{repair_monies} is distributed evenly to each \code{buildingid} 
#'  included in the \code{blockbuster_tibble}. Grade D, C and B condition 
#'  building components are repaired to A in that order. Partial repairs does not happen
#'  and any overspend is discarded (spent by the school on other things).
#' 
#' Outputs a blockbuster_tibble after spending \code{repair_monies} on a finite
#' number of blocks. Repairing a block attempts to convert some 
#' (depending on \code{repair_monies} available) of it's building components
#' back to grade A, making it Excellent condition. If the building components have
#' zero cost they are assumed to be grade N or A (this is not always true) and are not
#' repaired (the cost model is the issue not the assumption). The input is seperated into
#' a list of dataframes by block and then \code{repair_status} binary variable added using 
#' the internal helper function \code{\link{what_needs_repair_within_block}}. The repairs are 
#' then carried out an additional helper function called ...
#' 
#'
#' @param blockbuster_tibble a blockbuster dataframe or tibble.
#' @param repair_monies a vector of length one. 
#' @return A \code{blockbuster_tibble} that has had building components repaired
#'  (or not if \code{repair_monies} are 0).
